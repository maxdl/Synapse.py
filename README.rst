Synapse.py
==========

Synapse.py is a software tool for analysis of immunogold labeled electron
micrographs. Specifically, it is used to analyse gold labeling associated with
synaptic compartments comprising open pre- and postsynaptic membranes and
a postsynaptic density adjunct to the postsynaptic membrane. It is of course
also possible to use the tool for other types of two-dimensional spatial
point patterns and synaptic-like structures.

Synapse.py is used in conjunction with its companion ImageJ plugin,
Synapse_.java.
